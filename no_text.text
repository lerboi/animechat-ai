FOR PROFILE PAGE / BILLINGS AND PAYMENTS

{insert schema.prisma}

Above is my schema.prisma for reference

I want to create a Profile page where users can view their profile information, as well as billing and payment info in my Next.js 14 App Router project (using only JavaScript, no TypeScript).

Navbar.jsx:

Replace the SlLogout icon with the user's avatar/profile picture displayed in a circle.
If thereâ€™s no avatar/profile picture, import { CgProfile } from react-icons/cg and display that icon instead.
Make the icon/avatar clickable to open the Profile page.
page.js:

Modify the code so that if navItem === "Profile", it returns the Profile.jsx component.
Profile.jsx:

Create this component to display information from the User model in schema.prisma.
UI Design:

Add a vertical line on the left to separate user profile info from a list of settings.
Include two items in the settings list: "Profile", "Payments", and "Billing".
Payments.jsx and Billings.jsx:

Create these components as placeholders.

Note that i am using NextJS 14 with the App router and usingl only Javascript, no Typescript
