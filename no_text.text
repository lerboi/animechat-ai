{insert schema.prisma}

Above is my prisma schema for reference

Your Task:
Token Check & Dialog Implementation:
When the user has 0 Message Tokens and tries to send a message, a dialog box will appear with the message:
"You have run out of tokens."

Two buttons will be shown:
"Buy more"
Clicking this will redirect the user to the store page.
"Cancel"
Clicking this will close the dialog and cancel the action.
The same behavior applies when the user has 0 Image Tokens and tries to upload an image.

Requirements:
The logic for checking tokens should integrate with useTokens() to ensure tokens are only deducted if available.
The dialog should be reusable for both text and image token checks.
On clicking "Buy more", the user should be redirected to /store.
