Let’s walk through the database design and workflows for both scenarios in detail.

### General Overview
The database design revolves around the `User`, `Character`, `UserCharacter`, and `Persona` models:

- **User**: Represents users of the platform. Each user can add different characters to their chat list.
- **Character**: Represents the base character. This could be shared among different users, but each user will have their own unique interaction (i.e., their own chat history) with that character.
- **UserCharacter**: This is a join table that links a user to a specific version of a character. It also holds the user-specific `chatHistory` and version number for that character.
- **Persona**: Represents additional metadata about the character, like age, gender, etc. All users that add the same character will share the same persona data.

### Scenario 1: A User Wants to Add a New Character to His Chat List
In this scenario, a user wants to add a new character to their chat list. The key is that the character will have the same persona data, but the `chatHistory` will be user-specific and stored in the `UserCharacter` table.

#### Workflow

1. **Step 1: Query for the Character**
   - First, you need to retrieve the base `Character` and its related `Persona` from the `Character` table. This will serve as the template for the character the user is adding.
   
   ```js
   const character = await prisma.character.findUnique({
     where: { id: characterId }, // Use the id of the character the user wants to add
     include: { personaData: true } // Include persona information
   });
   ```

   - The `character` object now contains the character details and persona data.

2. **Step 2: Create a New Entry in `UserCharacter`**
   - Next, you need to add an entry in the `UserCharacter` table that links the user to this character. This entry will have a version number (starting with `1` since it’s a new addition) and an empty chat history.
   
   ```js
   const userCharacter = await prisma.userCharacter.create({
     data: {
       userId: userId,            // The ID of the user adding the character
       characterId: character.id, // The ID of the character being added
       version: 1,                // Version starts at 1 for the new character
       chatHistory: [],           // Start with an empty chat history
       personaId: character.personaData?.id // Copy the personaId from the character
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Result**:
   - The user now has their own version of the character, with their own chat history stored in `UserCharacter`. The base character data and persona are shared with other users who add the same character.

#### Database Interaction Summary:
- **Character** data comes from the `Character` table.
- A new record is created in the `UserCharacter` table, linking the user to this character.
- `chatHistory` is stored in `UserCharacter` as an empty array initially, and it will grow as the user interacts with the character.

### Scenario 2: A User Wants to View All the Characters They Have Added to Their Chat List
In this scenario, you want to show the user all the characters they have added to their chat list. This list is unique to the user because different users can add different characters.

#### Workflow

1. **Step 1: Query the `UserCharacter` Table for the User**
   - To get all characters a user has added, you would query the `UserCharacter` table for that specific user. This will give you access to the `characterId` as well as any user-specific fields like `chatHistory` and `version`.
   
   ```js
   const userCharacters = await prisma.userCharacter.findMany({
     where: { userId: userId }, // The ID of the user who is viewing their characters
     include: {
       character: {
         include: { personaData: true } // Include related character and persona data
       }
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Step 2: Process the Query Result**
   - The result of this query (`userCharacters`) will be an array of `UserCharacter` records, each of which will include:
     - The base `Character` data (name, description, etc.).
     - The `chatHistory` (which is specific to the user).
     - The `version` of that character for that user.
     - Any related `Persona` data for the character.

   Example result:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": 1,
       "characterId": 5,
       "chatHistory": ["Hello", "How are you?"],
       "version": 1,
       "character": {
         "name": "Anime Character 1",
         "description": "A popular anime character",
         "personaData": {
           "age": "18",
           "gender": "Female",
           // More persona fields
         }
       }
     },
     {
       "id": 2,
       "characterId": 7,
       "chatHistory": [],
       "version": 1,
       "character": {
         "name": "Anime Character 2",
         "description": "Another anime character",
         "personaData": {
           "age": "21",
           "gender": "Male",
           // More persona fields
         }
       }
     }
   ]
   ```

   - You can now display this data to the user, showing each character they have added to their chat list. Each character will have its own version and chat history.

#### Database Interaction Summary:
- **UserCharacter** links each user to their version of a character.
- **Character** and **Persona** data are retrieved through relations in `UserCharacter`.
- The result contains all the characters the user has added, with their specific chat histories and any additional metadata.

---

### Workflow Breakdown for Both Scenarios

#### Scenario 1 (Add a Character):
- **Step 1**: Query the base `Character` (and optionally the associated `Persona`).
- **Step 2**: Insert a new record in `UserCharacter` with the user’s ID, the character’s ID, an empty `chatHistory`, and the `version` set to 1.

#### Scenario 2 (View Added Characters):
- **Step 1**: Query the `UserCharacter` table for the specific user.
- **Step 2**: Join with the `Character` and `Persona` tables to retrieve character details.
- **Step 3**: Return a list of characters the user has added, along with their own unique chat history and version.

### Advantages of This Design
- **User-Specific Versions**: The `UserCharacter` table ensures that each user has their own version of a character. This includes unique chat history and versioning.
- **Shared Persona Data**: The `Persona` and `Character` tables ensure that common data (e.g., character description and persona details) are shared across users.
- **Flexibility**: The schema allows you to easily fetch all the characters a user has added, along with their individual versions and chat histories.
